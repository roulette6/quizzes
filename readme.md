# Backend web development quizzes
Reading the book *Make it Stick* and watching the free Coursera course *Learning How to Learn*, I've learned better ways to retain and ascertain knowledge of subjects and skills.

People learning something often overestimate how well they know it. There are two major mistakes responsible for this:

1. Fluency with syntax (i.e., exact phrasing) of the material being studied does not mean a grasp of the underlying concepts. It's best to state what you've learned in your own words and identify examples that aren't exactly like the ones you learned.
2. Massed practice (cramming) leads to better recall of the material in the short-term, but the material is soon forgotten.

There are three strategies to help you both gauge how well you know something and to retain it.

## Quiz yourself
Quizzing yourself helps you gauge how well you really know something. More importantly, it helps you halt forgetting. When quizzing yourself, try hard to arrive at the answer on your own before checking whatever resource you're using. Some difficulty is desired as effortful retrieval will help forge connections that will lead to long-term learning.

## Space out practice
While cramming makes you perform better in the short-term, spaced out practice has been shown to lead to superior long-term retention.

## Interleave practice
Just like you don't want to cram, you also don't want to study the same thing for too long to fool yourself you've mastered it. Switch from one topic to another (say, from PHP to JavaScript or from PHP streams to PDO) and back again. The reason this works is that you're drawing from long-term memory instead of mindlessly drawing from short-term memory.

When you interleave practice, don't practice things in the same order every time. That's called blocked practice and it's not as effective.
